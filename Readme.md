This example demonstrates how to use the DirectX-based "Zoom Transition" animation provided by the DevExpress Transition Manager component.

In this example, the Zoom Transition effect animates the Data Grid's WinExplorerView that shows a folders and files on your local storage. The corresponding ZoomIn or ZoomOut animation effect is played when a user navigates to a child folder, or presses the "Back" button.
